   <h1>Introduction</h1>
   <p><b>what is Github ?</b></p>
   <p>GitHub is a web-based platform used for version control and collaborative software development. It allows developers to store, track, and manage code using Git, a version control system. GitHub enables multiple people to work on the same project, making it easy to track changes, resolve conflicts, and collaborate efficiently.</p>
   <p>Some key features of GitHub include:</p>
   <ol>
    <li><b>Repositories: </b>Projects are stored in repositories (or repos). These repositories can be public (open-source) or private (restricted access).</li>
    <li><b>Branches: </b>Developers can create different versions of the project to work on new features or fixes without affecting the main project.</li>
    <li><b>Pull Requests:</b> Once a developer is done working on a branch, they can submit a pull request to merge their changes into the main project.</li>
    <li><b>Issues and Discussions: </b>GitHub allows teams to track bugs, enhancements, or general discussions using issues or discussion boards.</li>
    <li><b>Actions:</b> It provides CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) functionality, allowing automation of testing and deployment workflows.</li>
   </ol>
   <p style="padding-top: 70px;color: grey;">GitHub has become a central hub for open-source development and is widely used by both individual developers and large organizations.</p>
